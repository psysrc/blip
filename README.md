# BLiP

BLiP intends to be a simple program for parsing string manipulation code in a DSL (Domain Specific Language).

Using this program, the DSL can be parsed into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).
This AST can then either be directly interpreted, or compiled into a target language such as Python.

The DSL is syntactically inspired by BNF (Backus-Naur Form) but does not behave the same.
This is where BLiP originally derived its name: BNF Lite Parser.
However, because the BLiP DSL grammar is functionally different from BNF, this is a misnomer.
Therefore, officially, BLiP is a standalone name and is not an acronym.
