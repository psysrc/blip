# BLiP: BNF Lite Parser

This is intended to be a simple parsing program which takes "BNF Lite" syntax and produces an AST.
This AST can then be used either by an interpreter or to be compiled into a target language.

"BNF Lite" is an approximation of (BNF)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_form] with slightly different syntax.

The intention of BLiP is to be able to write in a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) which is useful and convenient for string parsing.
