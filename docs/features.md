# Blip Features

## String Literals

A literal string defined in the program.

## Identifiers

An arbitrary number of identifiers can be used in a Blip program to help organise data.
They're just like variables in a traditional programming language.

## IN and OUT

`IN` and `OUT` are special identifiers that represent the input and output of a Blip program, respectively.
A list of strings comes `IN` to the program, and a list of strings go `OUT` of the program.
